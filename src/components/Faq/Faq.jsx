                An artifact is any object made or used by humans in the past
                that provides insights into history, culture, or daily life.

              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-slate-300">
                Artifacts are preserved through careful conservation techniques,
                including climate control, protective casings, and restoration
                processes. Museums and archaeologists take special precautions
                to prevent decay and damage.

              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-slate-300">
                Artifacts are typically discovered through archaeological
                excavations, historical sites, ancient ruins, and sometimes even
                by accident. They can also be found in private collections and
                museum archives.

              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-slate-300">
                Artifacts help historians and researchers understand ancient
                civilizations, their traditions, technology, and daily lives.
                They provide valuable evidence about how societies evolved over
                time.

                Can I donate an artifact to a museum?
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-slate-300">
                Yes, many museums accept artifact donations, but they typically
                require proper documentation regarding the artifactâ€™s origin,
                authenticity, and ownership history to ensure ethical
                acquisition and preservation.

              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-slate-300">
                Authenticity is determined through expert analysis, including
                material testing, carbon dating, stylistic comparisons, and
                historical records. Museums and professional archaeologists use
                these methods to verify the age and origin of artifacts.
